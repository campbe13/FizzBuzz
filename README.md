# Fizz Buzz

Fizz Buzz is a coding challenge which (used to be?) given to
interview candidates.   I wanted to learn Golang and I was searching
for an idea.  I thought why not try FizzBuzz just to get started.
Then I had another thought, what would FizzBuzz look like in
other languages, so here it is.  

## What is it?
(fizz buzz wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz]

In short the challenge is to write code that will display
numbers from 1 to 100.   The catch is that for any number divisible by 3, show Fizz instead of the number.  For any number divisible by
5 show Buzz instead of the number.   For any number divisible by
both 3 and 5 show FizzBuzz instead of the number.

Here goes, I will update the list as I go along

* FizzBuzz.sh   bash
* FizzBuzz2.sh  bash  (work in progress)
