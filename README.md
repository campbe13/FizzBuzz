# Fizz Buzz

Fizz Buzz is a coding challenge which (used to be?) given to
interview candidates.   I wanted to learn Golang and I was searching
for an idea of what to write.  I thought why not try FizzBuzz just to get started.
Then I had another thought, what would FizzBuzz look like in
other languages, so here it is.  

## What is the Fizz Buzz coding challenge?
[fizz buzz wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)

In short the challenge is to write code that will display numbers from 1 to 100:   
1. For any number divisible by 3, show Fizz instead of the number.  
2. For any number divisible by 5 show Buzz instead of the number.   
3. For any number divisible by
both 3 and 5 show FizzBuzz instead of the number.
